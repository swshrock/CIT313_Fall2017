Source files for Week 3 - PHP Debugging

This assignment will test your debugging skills.



You have been provided with the source code for a site. The site allows users to create an inventory of produce items and then present those items for sale. The site’s name is I’ve Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts.



The source code I’ve provided to you doesn’t work. It is up to you to debug the site and make it function correctly. 

 

To see how the site is supposed to work, visit this page:

http://corsair.cs.iupui.edu:19031/CIT313/FA2015/a1/



Download the source code from GitHub (you must be logged in):  https://github.com/crobertdillon/CIT313_Fall2017/tree/master/Debug-Exercise-master  (Feel free to clone or fork but the easiest for this assignment is to choose 'Download Zip' in the lower right hand corner)

Unzip these files to your local 'a1' directory - ensure you update  the URL_ROOT and ABSOLUTE_PATH constants in your webconfig.inc.php file to match your directories on the Tomcat server.



Use your debugging skills to fix the coding errors in the source code provided.
When you find a bug, fix the error and place a comment in your code explaining what and why you changed
Example:  //added semicolon to allow code to properly execute
Share questions and code snippets in the forums but don’t give away the answers!! Instead, steer your fellow students in the right direction.


Once your copy of the store site matches the functionality of the sample above, you are done with this Assignment (but please continue to participate in the forums!!)



Your Assignment files must be uploaded to the Tomcat server to be graded. Once uploaded, you should review the files to ensure that they all appear properly. You must also sync your files to your GitHub server.



Provide the URL to both your working files on Tomcat as well as the link to your GitHub repository containing this exercise in the provided text box below.



20 points of your grade will be based on completion of the debugging and 10 points will based on forum participation.

 

HINT: There are more than 5 errors, but less than 15.
